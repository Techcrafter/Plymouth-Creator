# Plymouth-Creator
A tool using GTK 3 and Python 3 to easily create your own plymouth boot animations from an .mp4 video or single .png files with a GUI.


## What does this tool do:
With the help of this tool, you can create your own plymouth boot animations with just a few clicks.
You can use an existing .mp4 video or even single .png files to create your own customized boot animation for linux.
When you're done, you can apply it on your own computer, or you can share it with the community.

## Dependencies:
- python3
- python3-gi
- python3-tk
    + `apt-get install python3-tk`
    + `pip3 install tk`
- ffmpeg


## How to run:
Download the .zip or the .tar.gz file with the source code from the [releases section](https://github.com/Techcrafter/Plymouth-Creator/releases) and extract it.

On Debian based systems, open the file "RUN ME.sh" in the terminal to install the needed dependencies. Alternatively, install the [dependencies](#dependencies) manually.

The script will install the needed packages, so you'll eventually need to enter your sudo password.
Afterwards, the script will launch the GUI and you can start working on your custom boot animation.
